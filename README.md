# My Dot Files
This is a repo to store my dot files

## Requirements
1. [nvim](www.github.com/neovim)
2. [NerdFont](www.github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#font-installation)

## NeoVim
I come from using VSCode religiously and to learn more on how to use vim, I've worked towards having keybinds that simulate an evironment I am/used to be more comfortable with.
### Keybinds
* Ctrl + P - fzf (fuzzy finder)
* Ctrl + B - NerdTree
* Ctrl + / - Comment/Uncomment
* [VISUAL MODE] Ctrl + N - Multi Cursor
